**tables**
instacart_reviews
id:int
customer_id:int
store_id:int
score:int

instacart_stores
id:int
name:varchar
zipcode:int
opening_date:datetime

**solution**
1. extract all demanded conditions from description
+ stores open in the second half of 2021: opening_date between 2021-07-01 and 2021-12-31
+ stores that more than 20% of reviews has score < 5
+ return store name, ratio of (negative count/positive count)


2. find stores that satisfy the openning time

```mysql

SELECT * FROM instacart_reviews r JOIN instacart_stores s
ON r.store_id = s.id
WHERE s.opening_date BETWEEN '2021-07-01' AND '2021-12-31'

```

4. filter the stores by review score condition

```mysql

GROUP BY s.name
HAVING SUM(r.score<5)/COUNT(*) > 0.2

```

5. combine together and return the demanded columns: store name and review ratio

```mysql

SELECT s.name, SUM(r.score<5)/SUM(r.score>=5) as review_ratio
FROM instacart_reviews r JOIN instacart_stores s
ON r.store_id = s.id
WHERE s.opening_date BETWEEN '2021-07-01' AND '2021-12-31'
GROUP BY s.name
HAVING SUM(r.score<5)/COUNT(*) > 0.2

```
